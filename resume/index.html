    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Multimedia Journalist</h3>
    <h4>NET News</h4>
    <h5>2018-2020</h5>
    <p>I covered COVID-19 and the March 2019 flood for NET, as well as a variety of hard news and feature topics affecting Nebraskans. I served as a substitute host for All Things Considered and Morning Edition. I also edited stories for interns and fellow reporters.</p>

    <h3>All Things Considered Intern</h3>
    <h4>NPR</h4>
    <h5>2018</h5>
    <p>I supported the production of the daily All Things Considered program by booking guests, writing interview questions, and preparing research packets for program hosts. I also synced live and taped interviews with lawmakers and learned to cut interviews to time on a deadline. </p>

    <h3>Student Reporter</h3>
    <h4>Alabama Public Radio</h4>
    <h5>2016-2018</h5>
    <p>As a student reporter I produced radio stories on topics ranging from Alabama politics to roller-derby. My coverage was included in award-winning coverage of the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination and the 2017 Special Senate Election. As a more senior intern I helped to train new students and pitched during semi-annual on-air fund-drives.</p>

    <h3>All Things Considered Host and Reporter</h3>
    <h4>KDLG</h4>
    <h5>2017</h5>
    <p>During the summer of 2017 I covered local government in Dillingham, Alaska, in addition to general assignment coverage, which included sport salmon fishing and an expedition of Russian kayakers retracing a historical exploration route. I anchored the station’s evening newscasts and some noon broadcasts and provided vital tide and weather information to the area’s many fishing vessels.</p>
